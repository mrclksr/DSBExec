== Configuring the Look and Behavior of Qt6 Applications

If you are not using a desktop environment that takes care of your Qt
application's look and behavior, you can use
https://freshports.org/misc/qt6ct[_qt6ct_] together with the
https://www.freshports.org/x11-themes/Kvantum[_Kvantum_] theme engine.

[[kvantum]]
=== qt6ct and the Kvantum theme engine

==== qt6ct

https://freshports.org/misc/qt6ct[_qt6ct_] is a tool that allows you to
configure themes, fonts, and icons of Qt6 applications.
It can be installed via `pkg`

[source,sh]
----
# pkg install qt6ct
----

or via the FreeBSD ports:

[source,sh]
----
# cd /usr/ports/misc/qt6ct
# make install
----

In order to make Qt6 applications use _qt6ct_, add the line
`export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct` to one of the following files, depending
on how you start your X session:

[[session_files]]
.Session Files
[options="header,footer"]
|==================================================
|X Session Start Method           |File
|_SliM_, _startx_, _xinit_        |`~/.xinitrc`
|_GDM_, _LightDM_, _LXDM_, _SDDM_ |`~/.xprofile`
|_WDM_, _XDM_                     |`~/.xsession`
|==================================================

Alternatively, you can add the line to your window manager's startup
script, or, if you are using a Bourne shell compatible login shell, to
your `~/.profile`.

After loggin out and in again, proceed with the next section.

==== Kvantum

https://www.freshports.org/x11-themes/Kvantum[_Kvantum_] is a SVG-based theme
engine for Qt, KDE and LXQt. Install it via `pkg`:

[source, sh]
----
# pkg install Kvantum-qt6
----

or via the FreeBSD ports:

[source,sh]
----
# cd /usr/ports/x11-themes/Kvantum
# make install distclean
----

Start `qt6ct` and choose *_kvantum_* under *_Appeareance_* -> *_Style_*, and
press _Ok_.

[TIP]
====
You can use _Kvantum_ directly without _qt6ct_ by setting
`QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum`. Note, however, that the _Kvantum Manager_
lacks the ability to change fonts and the icon theme.
====

Now you can start `kvantummanager` to set, install and configure themes.

[TIP]
====
You can download
link:https://store.kde.org/browse/cat/123/order/latest[Kvantum themes]
from https://store.kde.org[KDE Store]. Unpack them, and use the
_Kvantum Manager_ to install new themes.
